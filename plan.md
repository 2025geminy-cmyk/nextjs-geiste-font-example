Below is the detailed implementation plan with all the dependent files and changes. Follow the step-by-step outline to ensure that every piece of the system—including UI elements, API endpoints, error handling, and security best practices—is fully integrated into the existing Next.js codebase.

---

## 1. Overall Architecture and Features

- The website will be built on Next.js (using the app router), Typescript, and modern React.  
- It will include multiple pages: a Landing (Home) page, Chatbot page, Ticket System page, and Data Analysis (Analytics) page.  
- A complete backend simulation is included using Next.js API routes for both the chatbot and ticket system.  
- A common layout with a Navbar and Footer will be created to provide consistent navigation across pages.  
- Security improvements (via headers in next.config.ts) and robust error handling on API endpoints are applied.  

---

## 2. File and Component Changes

### A. Global Configuration

**File: next.config.ts**  
- **Change:** Add security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options) using the async headers() method.  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Open `next.config.ts` and add an async headers() function that returns an array of header rules.  
  2. Verify the headers are applied to all routes (using best practices for ciberseguridad).

---

**File: package.json**  
- **Change:** Check for required dependencies; if not already installed, add any needed packages (for instance, if using a chart library later).  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Verify dependencies; note that for our demo, manual chart drawing using `<canvas>` is acceptable.  

---

### B. Global Styles

**File: src/app/globals.css**  
- **Change:** Enhance the CSS for a modern, responsive layout.
- **Steps:**  
  1. Add/reset base styles for typography, spacing, and layout.
  2. Include custom styles for the Navbar, Footer, forms, and buttons.
  3. Ensure responsive design with media queries as needed.

---

### C. Layout and Navigation Components

**File: src/components/Navbar.tsx**  
- **Change:** Create a new functional component for the navigation bar.
- **Steps:**  
  1. Create `src/components/Navbar.tsx`.
  2. Add links using Next.js `<Link>` components to navigate to “Home,” “Chatbot,” “Tickets,” and “Analytics.”
  3. Use clear typography and spacing with plain text (no external icons).

---

**File: src/components/Footer.tsx**  
- **Change:** Create a Footer component for company information.
- **Steps:**  
  1. Create `src/components/Footer.tsx`.
  2. Add basic company info and legal disclaimers.
  3. Style the footer with modern typography and spacing.

---

**File: src/app/layout.tsx**  
- **Change:** Create a global layout wrapping all pages with Navbar and Footer.
- **Steps:**  
  1. Create or update `src/app/layout.tsx`.
  2. Import global stylesheet (`globals.css`), Navbar, and Footer.
  3. Wrap the `{children}` with Navbar at the top and Footer at the bottom.
  4. Implement error boundaries if desired.

---

### D. Page Components

**File: src/app/page.tsx (Landing/Home Page)**  
- **Change:** Create a landing page that presents the automation solution.  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Build a hero section with a large header, a descriptive paragraph about the system (e.g., “Optimización de tiempos de respuesta y atención 24/7”), and a call-to-action.  
  2. Include an `<img>` tag with a placeholder image:
     - `src="https://placehold.co/1920x1080?text=Innovative+automation+solution+hero+image"`
     - Provide highly descriptive `alt` text (e.g., “Placeholder for a modern, high-tech hero image showcasing an advanced automation system with AI integrated for customer service”).
     - Add an `onerror` fallback to preserve layout.
  3. Provide buttons or links to direct users to the Chatbot, Tickets, and Analytics pages.

---

**File: src/app/chatbot/page.tsx (Chatbot Interface)**  
- **Change:** Implement a complete chatbot user interface.
- **Steps:**  
  1. Design a clean chat window with a conversation area, an input field, and a submit button.
  2. On button click, send a POST request to `/api/chatbot` (see API Endpoint below).
  3. Use React state (`useState` and `useEffect`) to handle conversation history and error states.
  4. Display error messages in case the API call fails.

---

**File: src/app/tickets/page.tsx (Ticket System)**  
- **Change:** Create a ticket submission interface along with a list of submitted tickets.
- **Steps:**  
  1. Build a form with inputs for “Título” and “Descripción.”
  2. On form submission, send data via a POST request to `/api/tickets` (see API Endpoint below).
  3. Maintain a local state list that is updated after a successful submission.
  4. Validate input fields and show error messages if validation fails.

---

**File: src/app/analytics/page.tsx (Data Analysis Dashboard)**  
- **Change:** Build a dashboard page to visualize interactions, ticket counts, and chatbot usage.
- **Steps:**  
  1. Create metric display cards with text summaries.
  2. Include a simple `<canvas>` element (or an inline SVG) to simulate a chart of monthly interactions.
  3. Style the layout using modern spacing and typography to ensure clarity and readability.

---

### E. API Endpoints

**File: src/app/api/chatbot/route.ts**  
- **Change:** Create an API route for processing chatbot requests.
- **Steps:**  
  1. Accept only POST requests.
  2. Parse the incoming JSON body (expecting a “question” field).
  3. Simulate a chatbot response (e.g., return a canned response after a brief delay using `setTimeout`).
  4. Use try/catch for error handling and return a proper JSON error message for unexpected errors.
  5. Return HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 405 for method not allowed).

---

**File: src/app/api/tickets/route.ts**  
- **Change:** Build an API route to handle ticket submissions.
- **Steps:**  
  1. Support both GET and POST methods.
  2. For GET, return a simulated list of tickets (using an in-memory static array).
  3. For POST, validate the incoming ticket data (title and description) and append it to the in-memory array.
  4. Return confirmation and proper status codes.  
  5. Implement try/catch blocks for robust error handling.

---

## 3. Testing and Security Considerations

- For each API endpoint, perform tests using curl commands (for example, a POST to `/api/chatbot` with a sample JSON payload).  
- Ensure that all user inputs are validated and sanitized on the backend.  
- Verify that the security headers in `next.config.ts` are working as intended.  
- Maintain a fallback for images (using `onerror`) and ensure the layout remains intact.  
- Use meaningful error messages in both API responses and UI feedback to the user to enhance reliability and user experience.

---

## 4. Summary

- The plan includes updates to global configuration files (next.config.ts with security headers and globals.css for layout).  
- New components (Navbar and Footer) and a global layout (src/app/layout.tsx) provide consistent navigation.  
- Four main pages have been created: Home (Landing), Chatbot, Tickets, and Analytics, each with modern, responsive UI elements and clear calls to action.  
- API endpoints for both chatbot (src/app/api/chatbot/route.ts) and tickets (src/app/api/tickets/route.ts) simulate real-world backend processing with proper error handling.  
- The chatbot UI simulates a real chat experience with error displays and state management, while the ticket system offers form validation and dynamic updates.  
- The Analytics page uses a simple canvas-based chart for visual data presentation.  
- The integration ensures secure and efficient handling of data with best practices for ciberseguridad.  
- All file modifications have been designed to work cohesively within the existing Next.js codebase.
